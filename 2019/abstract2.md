Harness the power of your editor to write better code

#### Abstract ####

Do you want your editor do more for you? Your editor is designed to make your job easier, but you need to learn how to effectively use it.

Did you know your editor can:
* Integrate with your source control
* Run your tests and give you fast feedback
* Scan your code for syntax errors and dead code
* Evaluate lines of code in-line
* Improve in-file navigation through shortcuts for skipping words, functions, or the extremes of the file or row
* Quickly find files, occurrences of strings, replacing strings in an open file or the whole project
* Run an interpreter, console, or REPL easily transferring code between it and the source

You will see these features demoed in a text editor, visual editor, and full-blown IDE so you can see that other than static analysis, these features exist in all advanced editors.

Expect to walk away from the session with a list of powerful editor features you can use to improve your code quality today.

#### Bio ####
I'm Jerry, wearer of many hats; a christian, dad, husband, metal-head, and board-gamer.
Currently I am working at Aver Inc doing python and Spark to drive a super flexible analytics platform. 
I love hanging out with small crowds of people (like-minded or not) talking about Jesus, Emacs, dynamically typed languages, metal, or games, and just in general not being bored.
