Harness the power of your editor to write better code

#### Abstract ####

You're editor is a critical tool of your trade and it's powerful features are often left untouched.

Have you wished that you knew how to change all the occurrences of a string in your project home without opening each file at a time and changing the string by typing it?  
Would you like to be able to automatically check your code before saving a real obvious style or syntax violation?  
Maybe you'd just like to get to the end of any line without having to press the right arrow key 100 times.  

You're editor will dramatically improve these tasks and so many others.

In this demo we'll look at the wide range of features offered by several editors and IDEs that help you:  

 * Navigate through project files like butter
 * Follow all your style and syntax requirements
 * Prevent common errors
 * Interact with source control
 * and more!

Then you too will improve your code quality simply by using your editor better!

#### Bio ####
I'm Jerry, wearer of many hats; a christian, dad, husband, metal-head, and board-gamer.
Currently I am working at Aver Inc doing python and Spark to drive a super flexible analytics platform. 
I love hanging out with small crowds of people (like-minded or not) talking about Jesus, Emacs, dynamically typed languages, metal, or games, and just in general not being bored.
