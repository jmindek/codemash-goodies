Pipe operators and galactic domination; writing a simple Space Trader game in Elixir

#### Abstract ####

Meet Elixir; a modern functional language that runs on the Erlang VM. 

Using a simple Space Trader style game, we'll cover the basics of both Elixir and the functional style of coding.
You'll also learn about necessary tooling and the some quirky things that make the language feel cumbersome, but unique too.

Whether you are new to Elixir, functional programming or both, you'll be able to start coding your own game (or whatever) in Elixir today!
