Take what you've learned and DO something with it

#### Abstract ####

Today your community is very actively evolving. It is impossible to not consume news about languages, paradigms, new services, etc...
But, can you DO something with those bits that you find compelling?

In this session you'll learn:
* some low touch/low commitment ways to initiate doing; for example using unit tests to explore a language.
* when you've been "doing", what can you do to continue to build your expertise
* and more...

Then, you can go and get doing!
