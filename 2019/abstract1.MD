### Title ###

Take what you've learned and DO something with it

#### Abstract ####

Has this happened to you?

You hear or read about some language/technology/paradigm/service/etc... 
It's something cool, shiny, and of course will solve some really important problem.
Later that day, you Google it. You check out the Github or project's home page.
Maybe, you conceive some ideas about how to employ this thing.
Time passes and you've not yet started on those ideas.
More time passes, interest start to fade.
Then you hear about the _next_ thing and this happens all over again.

Is this a familiar scenario for you?
Without actually doing something with what you've learned, it's all to easy to move on to something new again and again.

You'll leave this session with real tactics to act on those ideas!
